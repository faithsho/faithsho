<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

<b> <a href="https://github.com/faithsho/Crunchbase-Web-Scraper/tree/main">Crunchbase Scraper</a> :</b>


  Data collection from Crunchbase, extracting company financial details for analysis.

  - Utilizes Selenium for web scraping with automated login and dynamic navigation.
  - Extracts company data such as location, employee count and funding details.
  - Adds randomized delays and handles exceptions to make the scraping process smoother and more reliable.


<b> <a href="https://github.com/faithsho/Tableau-Visualizations/tree/main">Tableau Visualizations</a> :</b>

- A curated set of Tableau dashboards and visualizations addressing a variety of topics and datasets


<b> <a href="https://github.com/faithsho/SQL-and-Python-Automated-Data-Transformation">SQL & Python Automated Data Transformation</a> :</b>

- Reads data from multiple columns in an excel sheet and transform it into a simplified two-column structure
 
 
<b> Mathematical Modelling of Tumor Growth in Presence of Treatment : </b>

  This project was for my master's research paper, where I simulated extinction times of cancer therapy treatment in the stochastic framework

  - The stochastic model uses the CTMC which accommodates the randomness of the treatment plan
  - The Gillespie Simulation Algorithm was used for the model check
  - Optimised the treatment based on my model and obtained eradication times and probabilities

<b> <a href="https://github.com/faithsho/Ycombinator-Web-Scraper">Ycombinator Scraper</a> :</b>


  Automates data collection from Ycombinator, extracting company financial details for analysis.

- Uses Selenium for web scraping with dynamic navigation and data extraction.  
- Gathers company links, founder names, Twitter handles, and LinkedIn profiles.  
- Implements random delays and exception handling for smoother and reliable scraping.
